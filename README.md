# queries
In approximately 2014 I was asked to assist with queries relating to my lab's work that required use of the Translational Core's Clinical Research Data Warehouse (CRDW). I present here a collection of queries that I have performed. 

Queries range in complexity from gathering of discrete values of particular MRNs, to parsing free text from medical records.

When parsing from medical records for vital information, I am always given the option to use ICD9 and ICD10 codes; however, these are used for billing purposes of the visit. They may not display all occurrences of diagnoses or be as descriptive as necessary, thus requiring further retrospective chart review.

Methods found here include:
    
    Parsing smaller sections of medical records for more specific searching capabilities
    Multi variate comparisons with respect to severity of disease and time points
    Parsing medication information from free text to determine the most recent use of prescriptions
